# Documentation for RIT Imaging Applications
Markdown files of documentation, with images published in /images folder. 

## Images in markdown
To avoid extra work to upload images to sharepoint and change markdown links, all images use absolute links to the images stored in this public github.

To add an image to markdown:
```
![](https://github.com/imageurl)
```

## To update to Sharepoint
1. Create new page or go to existing page and click Edit
2. Add or edit Markdown web part (you need to click plus in middle of page, not edge)
3. Copy entirety of markdown file. Check in the preview that images render as expected.
4. Republish
