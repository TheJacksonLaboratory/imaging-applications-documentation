# Documentation for RIT Imaging Applications
Markdown files of documentation, with images published in this github repo. 

# Tips for Markdown
## Images in markdown
To avoid extra work to upload images to sharepoint and change markdown links, all images use absolute links to the images stored in this public github.

To add an image to markdown:
```
![](https://github.com/imageurl)
```

## Lists
If you want to add anything on a new line between numbered lists (e.g. image links), indent them with four spaces to keep the numbering.

## Warning styling
Block quotes can be created with `>`, make sure to indent if between numbered list items.

# Tips for Sharepoint
## To update to Sharepoint
1. Create new page or go to existing page and click Edit
2. Add or edit Markdown web part (you need to click plus in middle of page, not edge)
3. Copy entirety of markdown file. Check in the preview that images render as expected.
4. Republish
