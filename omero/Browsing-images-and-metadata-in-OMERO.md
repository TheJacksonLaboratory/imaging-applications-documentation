## Accessing OMERO.web
If you have not accessed the JAX instance of OMERO before, please fill out an [Omero Access request ticket](https://jax.service-now.com/jax?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0ff8f9b5db5f9450b2d52eda489619b3), which can also be found by searching for OMERO in the service catalog.

Once you have received confirmation that you have access, you can log in at [omeroweb.jax.org](omeroweb.jax.org).

## Logging into OMERO.web
You can log into OMERO following the link above, or navigating to omeroweb.jax.org in your browser. If you find yourself at this Public User screen and need to log in, click the Login button in the upper right (red box).

## Browsing images in OMERO.web
Once you are logged in, you will be taken to the data view (see image below), which is broken into a navigation pane on the left, a thumbnail pane in the middle, and a metadata pane on the right.

Images are organized into Project and Datasets, which can explored via the navigation pane on the left. Note that you only see data for the current group and user, which can be selected using the dropdown menu in the upper left.

Images can be selected directly via the navigation pane, or via the thumbnail pane in the middle. Once an image is selected, you will be able to view its associated metadata in the pane on the right. Metadata views are also available for Project and Datasets.

## Viewing image detail
Our instance of OMERO.web has two different viewers that can be used to take a closer look at your images. To use the default viewer, simply double-click the image in which you are interested. However, we recommend using OMERO.iviewer, which has a nicer look in addition to a number of basic annotation and analysis tools. To use OMERO.iviewer, click on the Open with... button near the top of the metadata pane (see the red box in the image below).

Images can be opened with either the default viewer or OMERO.iviewer (recommended).
